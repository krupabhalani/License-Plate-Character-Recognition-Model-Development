# License-Plate-Character-Recognition-Model-Development

Description: Developed a deep learning model using a Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) architecture to perform character recognition on vehicle license plate images. Gained hands-on experience across the complete machine learning workflow â€” from data preparation to model evaluation.

Preprocessed and transformed image-text data through resizing, normalization, and alphanumeric encoding for model readiness.

Designed and implemented a CRNN model in TensorFlow/Keras, combining convolutional layers for visual feature extraction and recurrent layers for sequence prediction.

Trained and evaluated the model using performance metrics to ensure high accuracy in character recognition.

Strengthened understanding of deep learning and computer vision by applying theoretical knowledge to real-world datasets.

Tech Stack: Python, TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
